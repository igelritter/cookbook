Git Essentials Tutorial Repo

I'm working through the "Git Essentials" book. I have worked through all the chapters developing how git works locally. Now it's time to start working with remote repos. 

So, not much here. I just want to get more comfortable with git from the command line instead of working through an IDE. I want to understand better all the things that have been automated and abstracted away from me.
